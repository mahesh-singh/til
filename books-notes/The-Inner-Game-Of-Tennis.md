#The inner game of tennis

1. While playing any game there are two part, outer game and inner game. Inner game is all about self-doubt, concentration, nervousness and self-condemnation. 

2. Player who mastery this inner game by achieving high level concentration with relax and calm mind; he will discover true self confidence.

3. He get spontaneous performance which occurs only when mind is calm and seems at one with body.

4. Inner game uncover a will to win with unlock his energy which never discourage by loosing the game.

5. It uses a more unconscious mind more than deliberated self-conscious mind.

6. Every time your mind starts to leak away, simply bring it gently back.

7. Since the mind seems to have a will of its own, how can one learn to keep it in the present? By practice. There is no other way.

8. "Relax your forearm. Relax your mind. Simply relax into the present, focus on the seams of the ball, and let it happen."

9. I have found that the most direct means of increasing one's ability to concentrate is through the practice of meditation.

10. Concentration seemed to slow time down, giving me the necessary awareness to see and place the ball. One that has been effective for many of my students, is to focus attention on breathing.

11. Putting attention on breathing simply means observing my breath going in, going out, going in, going out in its natural rhythm. It does not mean intentionally controlling my breath. When we focus attention on breathing we are putting our conscious energy on something closely connected to the life energy of the body.

12. Anxiety is fear about what may happen in the future, and it occurs only when the mind is imagining what the future may bring.

13. But when your attention is on the here and now, the actions which need to be done in the present have their best chance of being successfully accomplished, and as a result the future will become the best possible present.
So after a point has ended and I'm returning to position or going to pick up a ball, I place my mind on my breathing.

14. Most of our suffering takes place when we allow our minds to imagine the future or mull over the past. It's difficult to have fun or to achieve concentration when your ego is engaged in a life-and-death struggle.

15. The mind's preoccupation with comparing oneself with others, thus preventing spontaneous action; thoughts of inferiority alternating with superiority, depending on the competition; fear of defeat.

16. One can never look good enough. What looks good to one person does not look so good to another.

17. In the New World, excellence is valued in all things. We live in an achievement-oriented society where a man is measured by his competence in various endeavors.

18. When love and respect depend on winning or doing well in a competitive society, it is inevitable (since every winner requires a loser and every top performance many inferior ones) that there will be many people who feel a lack of love and respect.

19. Lack of confidence in the one area tended to infect the other. Fortunately, the reverse was also true.

20. In contemporary Western culture there is a great deal of con-troversy about competition. One segment values it highly, believing that it is responsible for Western progress and prosperity. Another segment says that competition is bad; that it pits one person against another and is therefore divisive; that it leads to enmity between people and therefore to a lack of cooperation and eventual ineffectualness.

21. There would be no problem with competition if one's self-image were not at stake.

22. Be like a yogi, unconcerned with how well I was doing in relation to my opponent and absorbed solely in achieving excellence for its own sake.

23. The surfer waits for the big wave because he values the challenge it presents. He values the obstacles the wave puts between him and his goal of riding the wave to the beach. Why? Because it is those very obstacles, the size and churning power of the wave, which draw from the surfer his greatest effort.

24. It is only against the big waves that he is required to use all his skill, all his courage and concentration to overcome; only then can he realize the true limits of his capacities.

25. The obstacles are a very necessary ingredient to this process of self-discovery.

26. Winning is overcoming obstacles to reach a goal, but the value in winning is only as great as the value of the goal reached.

27. Reaching the goal itself may not be as valuable as the experience that can come in making a supreme effort to overcome the obstacles involved. The process can be more rewarding than the victory itself.

28. true competition is identical with true cooperation. In true competition no person is defeated.

29. Maximum effort does not mean the super-exertion of Self 1. It means concentration, determination and trusting your body to "let it happen/' It means maximum physical and mental effort.


30. When one is emotionally attached to results that he can't control, he tends to become anxious and then try too hard. But one can control the effort he puts into winning.

31. For the player of the Inner Game, it is the moment-by-moment effort to let go and to stay centered in the here-and-now action which offers the real winning and losing, and this game never ends.

32. The Inner Game frees the player from concern about the fruits of victory; he becomes devoted only to the goal of self-knowledge, to the exploration of his true nature at it reveals itself on level after level.

33. We worry too much and don't concentrate very well.

34. "Freaking out" is a general term used for an upset mind. The causes of "freak-outs" can be grouped into three categories: regret about past events; fear or uncertainty about the future; and dislike of a present event or situation. In all cases, the event and the mind's reaction to it are two separate things. It takes both to produce the result, but the freak-out is in and of the mind; it is not an attribute of the event itself.

35. I wonder how it will sound when I tell Barbara that I lost to George in straight sets ... I can just hear the guys at the office talking about it... I wonder what the boss is going to think about the report I submitted ... I really should have put more work into it... My position in the company isn't really that secure; I'd better buckle down next week ... I wonder if there's any other kind of work I could do if I happened to lose this job. . . . Needless to say, such a train of thought isn't going to help me swing smoothly and naturally on my next shot; Self 1 has too much riding on it to just let it happen. When such a mental process starts, try to stop it as soon as you recognize what is happening. The mind must be brought back to the here and now. If you have nothing better to focus your attention on, I have found it effective to concentrate my mind on the process of breathing, which automatically keeps me in the present. Another way to deal with the uncontrolled mind is to simply observe it. Attempt to stay uninvolved with your mind's trip and just see where it goes. This can be a good way to learn something about the games that Self 1 plays.

36. we learn to keep our minds in the present and decline to take fear trips into the future, we find that there is an automatic process which gives us the necessary resources to deal with the situation at hand.

37. Calmness does not mean lack of concern; it means the ability to separate the real from the unreal and thereby to take sensible action.

Perhaps this is an appropriate place to remind the reader that 1 am not suggesting "positive thinking" as the best means of overcoming freak-outs.

Positive thinking is the same kind of mental activity as negative thinking; it is the other side of the same coin and thus inextricably linked to it.

The mind only adds positive and negative attributes to events when it is not satisfied to see things as they are. Such a mind distorts reality in an attempt to gain a peace which it lacks.

The cause of all the freak-outs discussed above can be summed up in the word attachment.

it is the grip on wealth which makes a miser uptight and unhappy, not the wealth itself.


"Abandon" is a good word to describe what happens to a tennis player who feels he has nothing to lose. He stops caring about the outcome and plays all out. This is the true meaning of detachment.

The ghosts of the past and the monsters of the future disappear when all one's conscious energy is employed in understanding the present.


the art of concentration is basi-cally the art of experiencing ever more fully whatever is


in the here and now for you.


One day we get out of bed and the world looks full of beauty and interest; the next day everything appears drab. In each case the difference lies in our own state of consciousness.
