#Socket

A socket is a special file used for inter-process communication. These allow communication between two processes. 

File is created with .sock extension.

The .sock extension is used by Unix domain sockets as a convention, but not as a requirement. Unix domain sockets are special files used by different processes to communicate with each other - much like TCP/IP sockets.
